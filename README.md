# WireFrame 
Number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation.

## How to make your wireframe in six steps:
1. Do your research.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference.
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5. Add some detail and get testing.
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes.

### How to make your wireframe good:
* ***Clarity:*** Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs.

* ***Confidence :*** Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand.
* ***Simplicity is key :*** Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals.
